        <p>
          This horror co-op ghost hunting game is really fun, and it's always
          interesting for me every time I play it.

        <h3>Part 1</h3>
        <p>
          I loved this part of the game so much. It had a very interesting
          storyline, and the gameplay was also good. I'm a big fan of story
          games in general.
        </p>
        <h3>Part 2</h3>
        <p>
          I didn't really like this one as much as the other part, but it was
          still a fun experience for me.

        <p>
          This game is really good. The story is interesting and the gameplay is
          very good as well. I liked the combat with the magical abilities.
